Data Collection – Transactional data taken from SQL database and CSV sources.

Data Cleaning & Transformation – Used Power Query for removing nulls, formatting dates, categorizing expenditure, and shaping datasets.

Data Modeling – Established relationships between Card Category, Customers, Transactions, and Revenue tables.

Dashboard Development – Designed interactive Power BI visuals like KPI cards, bar charts, line charts, and slicers.

Insights & Analysis – Built drill-down features for transaction type, card category, and customer demographics.
